- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dr Jisha Chandroth Pannian holding a Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship @Unijena
- ğŸ‘€ Currently, my interests are in spin-orbit photonics where we 
demonstrated waveguiding based on Geometric phases in the absence 
of refractive-index-gradient in anisotropic material. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on designing integrated devices based on Geometric phase.
- Tools - FDTD, BPM, Machine learning
